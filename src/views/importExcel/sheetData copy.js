Definitions\n\n  a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other\n    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,\n    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or\n    phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any\n    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including\n    in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that\n    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose\n    of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an\n    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n  b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or\n    other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,\n    which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,\n    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its\n    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each\n    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are\n    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will\n    not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this\n    License.\n\n  c. \"Creative Commons Compatible License\" means a license that is listed at\n    http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by\n    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including,\n    at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same\n    purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,\n    (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made\n    available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons\n    jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.\n\n  d. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies\n    of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of\n    ownership.\n\n  e. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes as\n    selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution,\n    ShareAlike.\n\n  f. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that\n    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n  g. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the\n    individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no\n    individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in\n    the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other\n    persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise\n    perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the\n    case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first\n    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of\n    broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\n  h. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of\n    this License including without limitation any production in the literary,\n    scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its\n    expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other\n    writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a\n    dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in\n    dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic\n    work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to\n    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,\n    engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\n    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an\n    illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to\n    geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a\n    phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a\n    copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to\n    the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n  i. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who\n    has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\n    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise\n    rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n  j. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to\n    communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,\n    including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make\n    available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may\n    access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;\n    to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the\n    communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by\n    public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any\n    means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n  k. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without\n    limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and\n    reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected\n    performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or\nrestrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or\nexceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection\nunder copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\nhereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\nduration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work\nas stated below:\n\n  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,\n    and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly\n    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original\n    Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was\n    translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The\n    original work has been modified.\";\n\n  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in\n    Collections; and,\n\n  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n  e. \n\n    For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive\n        right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights\n        granted under this License;\n\n      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right\n        to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted\n        under this License; and,\n\n      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\n        royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a\n        member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\n        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted\n        under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\nhereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications\nas are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.\nSubject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby\nreserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject\nto and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this\n    License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n    for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the\n    terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise\n    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may\n    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this\n    License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the\n    Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work\n    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the\n    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section\n    4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not\n    require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the\n    terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any\n    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any\n    credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section\n    4(c), as requested.\n\n  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms\n    of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same\n    License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction\n    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same\n    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv)\n    a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under\n    one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that\n    license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses\n    mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply\n    with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following\n    provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable\n    License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that\n    restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient\n    of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n    terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with\n    every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the\n    Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the\n    Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from\n    You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the\n    Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n    from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable\n    License.\n\n  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section\n    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable\n    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author\n    (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author\n    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\n    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\n    Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other\n    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the\n    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI\n    does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a\n    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French\n    translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original\n    Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be\n    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of\n    a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit\n    for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as\n    part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits\n    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the\n    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You\n    may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,\n    sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n    Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without\n    the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise\n    permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform\n    the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You\n    must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in\n    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's\n    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.\n    Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this\n    License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,\n    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the\n    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not\n    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right\n    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not\n    otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS\nTHE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING\nTHE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR\nTHE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME\nJURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION\nMAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN\nNO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\n    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,\n    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or\n    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,\n    7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\n  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\n    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\n    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the\n    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and\n    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers\n    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\n    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\n    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by\n    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or\n    representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall\n    not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any\n    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\n    written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License\n    were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the\n    Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),\n    the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO\n    Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\n    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter\n    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are\n    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\n    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If\n    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes\n    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are\n    deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to\n    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\n\n  Creative Commons Notice\n\n  Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n  whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable\n  to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including\n  without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages\n  arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)\n  sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the\n  Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n  Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is\n  licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by\n  either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or\n  logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative\n  Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'\n  then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website\n  or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance\n  of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of the License.\n\n  Creative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.",

Modifications.\n\n    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed\n    by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your\n    Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient\n    rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n    3.3. Required Notices.\n\n    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You\n    as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any\n    copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered\n    Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n    attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\n    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\n    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\n    Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n    or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge\n    a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or\n    more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your\n    own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\n    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby\n    agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result\n    of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\n    terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which\n    may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n    Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights\n    in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n    distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\n    license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from\n    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or\n    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such\n    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    3.6. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\n    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as\n    a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of\n    this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n  4.  Versions of the License.\n\n    4.1. New Versions.\n\n    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n    revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version\n    will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in\n    Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify\n    this License.\n\n    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n    which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n    Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from\n    being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version\n    of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available\n    under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally\n    received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,\n    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms\n    of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for\n    Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this\n    License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the\n    name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from\n    this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains\n    terms which differ from this License.\n\n  5.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT\n  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\n  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK\n  AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\n  ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL\n  DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\n  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT\n  UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n  6.  TERMINATION.\n\n    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such\n    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by\n    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n    shall survive.\n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\n    Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to\n    as \"Participant\") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the\n    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original\n    Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or\n    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly\n    or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\n    Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of\n    such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw\n    Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such\n    Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with\n    Participant.\n\n    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any\n    distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n  7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF\n  ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN\n  IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS\n  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND\n  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  8.  U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n  The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48\n  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" (as that\n  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer\n  software documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through\n  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\n  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is\n  in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision\n  that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n  9.  MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n  enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the\n  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this\n  License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the\n  jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original\n  Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\n  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that\n  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n  apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance\n  with the United States export administration regulations (and the export\n  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or\n  otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n  10.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible\n  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization\n  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and\n  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.",

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging\n    that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent\n    where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of\n    the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be\n    taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n    license.\n\n    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any\n    distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n\n  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF\n  ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\n  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH\n  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS\n  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND\n  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n\n\n  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n  The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48\n  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that\n  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer\n  software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.\n  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through\n  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\n  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is\n  in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision\n  that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n\n\n  9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n  enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the\n  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this\n  License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the\n  jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original\n  Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The\n  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\n  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that\n  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n  apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance\n  with the United States export administration regulations (and the export\n  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or\n  otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n\n\n  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible\n  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization\n  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and\n  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE\n  (CDDL)\n\n  The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of\n  California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to\n  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the\n  Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of\n  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.",

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\ndistributed under this Agreement, and\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\ni) changes to the Program, and\n\nii) additions to the Program;\n\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\nContributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\nacting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\nthe Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\nconjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\nderivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including\nall Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,\nprepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and\nsublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\nworks, in source code and object code form.\n\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\nPatents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\nContribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\nThis patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\nProgram if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\naddition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\nLicensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\nwhich include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to\nits Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor\nthat the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\nrights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient\nfor claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\nproperty rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and\nlicenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to\nsecure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\nthird party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the\nProgram, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before\ndistributing the Program.\n\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright\nrights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in\nthis Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\nown license agreement, provided that:\n\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\nb) its license agreement:\n\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\nconditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\nnon-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\nfitness for a particular purpose;\n\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,\nincluding direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such\nas lost profits;\n\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by\nthat Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,\nand informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a\nmedium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\nProgram.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\noriginator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\nand costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\nextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\nThe obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to\nany actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an\nIndemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and\ncooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related\nsettlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\nCommercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\nrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial\nContributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial\nContributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to\nthose performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\nrights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of\nprogram errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\nprograms or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\nOUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\nterms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\nprovision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes\nsuch Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section\n2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply\nwith any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure\nsuch failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such\nnoncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\nsurvive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\nNo one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\nThe Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation\nmay assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable\nseparate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed\nsubject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\nafter a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to\ndistribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no\nrights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this\nAgreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights\nin the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after\nthe cause of action arose.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\nof the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\ncommit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\nprograms, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or\nmodify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free\nuse or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or\nwork, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n      that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n      this License.\n\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n      you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n      most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n      of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n      not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n      not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\nto work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to\ncontrol the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section\n2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\nprovided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\n      noncommercial distribution\n\nand only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\nexecutable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not\ninclude anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)\nwith the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system\non which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\nfrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third\nparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept\nthis License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\nbased on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\nor works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the\nrecipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\ndistribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may\nnot impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\ngranted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties\nto this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on\nyou (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is\nup to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software\nthrough any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is\npermitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\nversion number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\ndoes not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\never published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all\nderivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

It is numbered 2\n      because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n\nPreamble\n--------\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially\ndesignated Free Software Foundation software, and to other libraries whose\nauthors who decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nlibrary, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program\nwith the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so\nthat they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library\nand recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,\nand (2) offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone\nunderstands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what\nthey have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others\nwill not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually\nobtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary\nsoftware. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed\nfor everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,\nthe GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.\nThis license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in\nfull, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary\nlicense.\n\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur\nthe distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and\nsimply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library,\nis in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility\nprogram or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked\nexecutable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the\nordinary General Public License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License\nfor libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most\ndevelopers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might\npromote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of\nthose programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.\nThis Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free\nprograms to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such\nprograms to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not\nseen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved\nit as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that\nthis will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General\nPublic License rather than by this special one.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called\n\"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as\nto be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\nfunctions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\ndistributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the\nLibrary or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,\ntranslation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,\nplus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the\nLibrary is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the\nLibrary in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the\nLibrary does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer\nof warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\nabsence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\n      that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\n      third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\n      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other\n      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make\n      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not\n      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\n      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose\n      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,\n      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used\n      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,\n      the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\n      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\n      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be\n      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\n      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\n      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\n      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\n      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\n      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\n      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\n      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\n      based on the Library.\n\n      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\n      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage\n      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\n      this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a\nnewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has\nappeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any\nother change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and\nderivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into\na program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from\nthe same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object\ncode.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is\ndesigned to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called\na \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative\nwork of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of\nthe Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is\ntherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of\nsuch executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part\nof the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the\nLibrary even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\nsignificant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\nitself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by\nlaw.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and\naccessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in\nlength), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether\nit is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus\nportions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\nobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing\nthat work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with\nthe Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work\nthat uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\nthe Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\nthe terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must\nsupply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\nnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\nwell as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\nmust do one of these things:\n\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the\n      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the\n      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\n      machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source\n      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a\n      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that\n      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will\n      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified\n      definitions.)\n\n      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\n      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for\n      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\n      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\n      materials from the same place.\n\n      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\n      that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\ninclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from\nit. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the\nmajor components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which\nthe executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other\nproprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a\ncontradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an\nexecutable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\nthe separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\nlibrary facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\nthings:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\n      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\n      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of\n      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have\nreceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their\nlicenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept\nthis License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work\nbased on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library\nor works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties to this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on\nyou (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\nhave made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is\nup to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software\nthrough any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is\npermitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nLibrary General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new\nproblems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a\nversion number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\ndoes not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to\nask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions\nfor this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\nreuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nLIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nLIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\nto the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can\nredistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these\nterms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public\nLicense).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\nexclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line\nand a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n\n      Copyright (C) year name of author\n\n      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n\n      modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n\n      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n\n      version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\n      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\n      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n\n      Library General Public License for more details.\n\n      You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\n\n      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n\n      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a\nsample; alter the names:\n\n      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\n\n      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\n\n      by James Random Hacker.\n\n      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\n\n      Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!",

It also counts\n\n      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n\n      the version number 2.1.]\n\n\nPreamble\n--------\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\ndesignated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\nFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we\nsuggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\nGeneral Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,\nbased on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change\nthe software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\nthat you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nlibrary or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code\nwith the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so\nthat they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library\nand recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and\n(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\nwarranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else\nand passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by\nproblems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free\nprogram. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the\nusers of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.\nTherefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the\nlibrary must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\nlicense.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\napplies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary\nGeneral Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to\npermit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared\nlibrary, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore\npermits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\nThe Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other\ncode with the library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to\nprotect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\nprovides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\nnon-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\nPublic License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\nadvantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\nwidest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.\nTo achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more\nfrequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free\nlibraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to\nfree software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\nenables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\nexample, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\nmore people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the\nGNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\nfreedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\nLibrary has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified\nversion of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\nto run.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\nit may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also\ncalled \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as\nto be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\nfunctions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\ndistributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the\nLibrary or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,\ntranslation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,\nplus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the\nLibrary is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the\nLibrary in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the\nLibrary does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer\nof warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\nabsence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\n      that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\n      third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\n      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other\n      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make\n      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not\n      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\n      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose\n      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,\n      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used\n      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,\n      the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\n      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\n      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be\n      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\n      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\n      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\n      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\n      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\n      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\n      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\n      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\n      based on the Library.\n\n      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\n      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage\n      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\n      this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a\nnewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has\nappeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any\nother change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and\nderivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into\na program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from\nthe same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object\ncode.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is\ndesigned to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called\na \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative\nwork of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of\nthe Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is\ntherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of\nsuch executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part\nof the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the\nLibrary even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\nsignificant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\nitself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by\nlaw.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and\naccessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in\nlength), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether\nit is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus\nportions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\nobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing\nthat work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with\nthe Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work\nthat uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\nthe Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\nthe terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must\nsupply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\nnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\nwell as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\nmust do one of these things:\n\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the\n      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the\n      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\n      machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source\n      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a\n      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that\n      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will\n      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified\n      definitions.)\n\n      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A\n      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library\n      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library\n      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a\n      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the\n      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was\n      made with.\n\n      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\n      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for\n      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\n      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\n      materials from the same place.\n\n      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\n      that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\ninclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from\nit. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not\ninclude anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)\nwith the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system\non which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other\nproprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a\ncontradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an\nexecutable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\nthe separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\nlibrary facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\nthings:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\n      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\n      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of\n      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have\nreceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their\nlicenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept\nthis License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work\nbased on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library\nor works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on\nyou (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\nhave made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is\nup to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software\nthrough any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is\npermitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nLesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new\nproblems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a\nversion number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\ndoes not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to\nask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions\nfor this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\nreuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nLIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nLIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\nto the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can\nredistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these\nterms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public\nLicense).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\nexclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line\nand a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n\n      Copyright (C) year name of author\n\n      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n\n      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n\n      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n\n      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\n      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\n      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n\n      Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n\n      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n\n      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a\nsample; alter the names:\n\n      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\n\n      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\n\n      by James Random Hacker.\n\n      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\n\n      Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!",

                "GNU Lesser General Public License\n=================================\n\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\n\n      Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\n      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\n      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n      [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\n\n      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n\n      the version number 2.1.]\n\n\nPreamble\n--------\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\ndesignated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\nFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we\nsuggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\nGeneral Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,\nbased on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change\nthe software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\nthat you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nlibrary or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code\nwith the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so\nthat they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library\nand recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and\n(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\nwarranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else\nand passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by\nproblems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free\nprogram. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the\nusers of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.\nTherefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the\nlibrary must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\nlicense.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\napplies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary\nGeneral Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to\npermit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared\nlibrary, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore\npermits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\nThe Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other\ncode with the library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to\nprotect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\nprovides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\nnon-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\nPublic License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\nadvantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\nwidest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.\nTo achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more\nfrequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free\nlibraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to\nfree software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\nenables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\nexample, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\nmore people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the\nGNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\nfreedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\nLibrary has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified\nversion of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\nto run.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\nit may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also\ncalled \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as\nto be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\nfunctions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\ndistributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the\nLibrary or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,\ntranslation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,\nplus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the\nLibrary is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its\ncontents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the\nLibrary in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the\nLibrary does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer\nof warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\nabsence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\n      that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\n      third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\n      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other\n      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make\n      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not\n      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\n      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose\n      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,\n      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used\n      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,\n      the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\n      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\n      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be\n      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\n      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\n      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\n      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\n      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\n      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\n      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\n      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\n      based on the Library.\n\n      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\n      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage\n      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\n      this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a\nnewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has\nappeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any\nother change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and\nderivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into\na program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\nand 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from\nthe same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object\ncode.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is\ndesigned to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called\na \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative\nwork of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of\nthe Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is\ntherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of\nsuch executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part\nof the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the\nLibrary even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\nsignificant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\nitself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by\nlaw.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and\naccessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in\nlength), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether\nit is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus\nportions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\nobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing\nthat work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with\nthe Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work\nthat uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\nthe Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\nthe terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must\nsupply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\nnotices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\nwell as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\nmust do one of these things:\n\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the\n      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the\n      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete\n      machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source\n      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a\n      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that\n      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will\n      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified\n      definitions.)\n\n      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A\n      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library\n      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library\n      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a\n      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the\n      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was\n      made with.\n\n      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\n      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for\n      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\n      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\n      materials from the same place.\n\n      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\n      that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\ninclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from\nit. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not\ninclude anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)\nwith the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system\non which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other\nproprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a\ncontradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an\nexecutable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\nthe separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\nlibrary facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\nthings:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\n      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\n      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of\n      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have\nreceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their\nlicenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept\nthis License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work\nbased on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library\nor works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on\nyou (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\nhave made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is\nup to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software\nthrough any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is\npermitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nLesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new\nproblems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a\nversion number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\ndoes not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to\nask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions\nfor this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\nreuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nLIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nLIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\nto the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can\nredistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these\nterms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public\nLicense).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the\nexclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line\nand a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n\n      Copyright (C) year name of author\n\n      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n\n      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n\n      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n\n      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\n      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\n      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n\n      Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n\n      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n\n      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a\nsample; alter the names:\n\n      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\n\n      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\n\n      by James Random Hacker.\n\n      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\n\n      Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!",

Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims,\n  each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive\n  license\n\n      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n    Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,\n    sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or\n    portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as\n    Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of \n    Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination\n    with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use,\n    sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)\n    Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the\n    combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor\n    Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n    (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the\n    date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.\n\n    (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)\n    for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) \n    separate from the Contributor Version;  3)  for infringements caused by: i)\n    third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of\n    Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part\n    of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims\n    infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that\n    Contributor.\n\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n  3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You\n  contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without\n  limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n  distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this\n  License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License\n  with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose\n  any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable\n  version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may\n  include an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n  Section 3.5.\n\n  3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which\n  You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of\n  this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an\n  accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution\n  Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date\n  it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent\n  version of that particular Modification has been made available to such\n  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version\n  remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained\n  by a third party.\n\n  3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You\n  contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that\n  Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement\n  that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code\n  provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial\n  Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable\n  version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership\n  of the Covered Code.\n\n  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n    (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a\n    third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n    granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must\n    include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which\n    describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that\n    a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge\n    after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n    Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor\n    makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform\n    those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n    (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application\n    programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n    are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include\n    this information in the LEGAL file.  \n\n            (c)    Representations.\n\n    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)\n    above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are\n    Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights\n    to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n\n  3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file\n  of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular\n  Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look\n  for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your\n  name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\n  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You\n  describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You\n  may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer\n  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\n  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\n  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in\n  Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for\n  that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of\n  Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an\n  Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the\n  Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your\n  choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You\n  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n  Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in\n  the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n  distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it\n  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by\n  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\n  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability\n  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n  terms You offer.\n\n  3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with\n  other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n  with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,\n  or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the\n  maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\n  affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in\n  Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\n  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must\n  be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n  understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the\n  notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n  6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may\n  publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\n  version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n  6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a\n  particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the\n  terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the\n  terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n  other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\n  Code created under this License.\n\n  6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License\n  (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n  Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so\n  that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', \"MPL\",\n  ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except\n  to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it\n  clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n  Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the\n  Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n  Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\n  License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS\nIS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\nMERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\nCOVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR\nANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS\nLICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\nDISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION.\n\n  8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such\n  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the\n  Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this\n  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n  termination of this License shall survive.\n\n  8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\n  (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such\n  action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n  (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes\n  any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under\n  Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\n  Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of\n  notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually\n  agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made\n  by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the\n  Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a\n  reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\n  writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights\n  granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically\n  terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n  (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n  Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any\n  rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are\n  revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or\n  had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n  8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging\n  that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes\n  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)\n  prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable\n  value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2\n  shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment\n  or license.\n\n  8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end\n  user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall\n  survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,\nWHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\nINITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR\nANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\nMALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH\nPARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS\nSUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF\nINCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT\nAPPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n  The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.\n  2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and\n  ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48\n  C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.\n  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\n  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions\n  (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding\n  its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one\n  party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in\n  the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n  subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of\n  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing\n  party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and\n  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations\n  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible\n  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization\n  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and\n  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n  Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensedmeans that the Initial Developer permits\n  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the\n  alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file\n  described in Exhibit A.\n\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n  ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version\n  1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the\n  License.

These owners may contribute to\nthe Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of\ncreative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater\ndistribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work\n(the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected\nby copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\").\nCopyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n    and translate a Work;\n\n  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n    depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject\n    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a\n    Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or\nunknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in\nthe Work\n\n  i.  in all territories worldwide,\n\n  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including\n    future time extensions),\n\n  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and\n\n  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n    advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\").\n\nAffirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large\nand to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that\nsuch Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\ntermination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\nenjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express\nStatement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall\nbe preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged\nAffirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,\nnon sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to\nexercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work\n\n  i.  in all territories worldwide,\n\n  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including\n    future time extensions),\n\n  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and\n\n  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n    advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\").\n\nThe License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer\nto the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\ninvalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\nineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such\ncase Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not\n\n  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the\n    Work or\n\n  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the\n    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of\n    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other\n    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that\n    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any\n    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or\n    other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party\n    to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or\n    use of the Work.",
